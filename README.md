# MachineLearning
This project involved using an opensource dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository for hand gesture recognition from a wearable EMG armband (Myo Armband EMG)
* The Myo EMG armband is a wearable device that allows for the gesture control of various electronic devices.
* The armband uses electromyography (EMG) technology to detect and interpret the electrical activity of the muscles in your forearm.
* This allows you to control devices such as computers, smartphones, and even drones, simply by making movements with your arm.
